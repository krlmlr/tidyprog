# Introduction

The `tidyverse` has quickly developed over the last years.
Its first implementation as a collection of partly older packages was in the second half of 2016.
All its packages "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."^[citation from [tidyverse homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/)]
It is for sure difficult to tell, if "learning the `tidyverse`" is a hard task, since the result of this assessment might differ from person to person.
We do believe though, that there are concepts in its approach, which -- when grasped -- have the potential to increase one's productivity, since code creation will seem more natural.
While this might be true for all languages (once you speak it well enough, things go smoothly), in our opinion the `tidyverse` worth exploring in depth, since it is

1. consistent: an especially well designed framework that aims at making data analysis and programming intuitive,
2. evolving: constantly deepened understanding for challenges arising in modern data analysis leads to improving ergonomic user interfaces.

This section gives a brief overview, introduces the data used for the course, and offers a refresher for tidy data manipulation and visualization.

## Overview

This course covers several topics, which everyone working more intently with the `tidyverse` almost inevitably needs to deal with at some point or another.
The topics are organized in chapters that contain mostly R code with output and text.
In each section, exercises are provided.

Each subsection corresponds to an R script in the [`script` directory](`r tidyprog_repo("script")`) in the [sister repository on GitHub](`r tidyprog_repo()`).
For example, the code from the next section 1.2 can be found in [`12-intro.R`](`r tidyprog_repo("script", "12-intro.R")`).
Clone or download the repository and open the `R-workshop.Rproj` file to run the script.
(It is important to open the `.Rproj` file and not only the `.R` scripts.)

##### Function basics

> structuring the code to avoid too much copy-pasting

Using functions to structure code. This part is independent of the subsequent section.

1. We begin with how to define and execute a function
2. Discussion of a function's arguments (from both the developers' and the users' perspective)
3. A few words on function design

##### Simple iteration

> processing multiple files that contain different parts of the same dataset

This part introduces iteration and is independent of the previous section.

1. How to get from a list or a vector to a tibble and vice-versa
1. Indexing for vectors and lists
1. Applying a function to each element of a list or a vector

##### Pairwise iteration and nesting

More advanced iteration.

1. Simultaneously feed two or more separate lists of inputs into a function working with those two arguments
2. Iterate rowwise through columns in a tibble
3. Nested tibbles, a very powerful concept

##### Scoping and flow control

More advanced functional concepts.

1. Data lifecycle
2. Purity
3. Control flow
4. Metaprogramming

##### Non-rectangular data

> working with raw data from online services (JSON)

Processing hierarchical lists as commonly returned from web APIs.

1. Data lifecycle
2. Purity
3. Control flow
4. Metaprogramming

##### Tidy evaluation

> writing functions that work with datasets of different shape

TBD

```{r child = here("script", "1.Rmd")}
