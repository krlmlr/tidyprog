# Introduction

The `tidyverse` has quickly developed over the last years.
Its first implementation as a collection of partly older packages was in the second half of 2016.
All its packages "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."^[citation from [tidyverse homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/)]
It is for sure difficult to tell, if "learning the `tidyverse`" is a hard task, since the result of this assessment might differ from person to person.
We do believe though, that there are concepts in its approach, which -- when grasped -- have the potential to increase one's productivity, since code creation will seem more natural.
While this might be true for all languages (once you speak it well enough, things go smoothly), in our opinion the `tidyverse` worth exploring in depth, since it is 
    1. an especially thought through framework that aims at making programming intuitive
    2. evolving: challenges in the quickly changing world of hardware and software technology are addressed by `tidyverse` developers on comparably short notice

This course covers several topics, which everyone working more intently with the `tidyverse` almost inevitably needs to deal with at some point or another.

The first part, "Simple iteration":

1. We start off with an overview of basic issues, like data visualization and data exploration using packages `ggplot2` and `dplyr`
2. Then we look at how to get from a list or a vector to a tibble and vice-versa
3. Next topic is indexing for vectors and lists
4. Applying a function to each element of a list or a vector

The second part, "Function basics":

1. We begin with how to define and execute a function
2. A functions arguments (from a developer's and from a user's perspective)

The third part, "Pairwise iteration and nesting":

1. Simultaneously feed 2 separate lists of inputs into a function working with those two arguments
2. Iterate through column entries of a tibble
3. Nested tibbles

The fourth part, "Scoping and flow control":
