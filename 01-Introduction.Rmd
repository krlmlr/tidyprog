Its first implementation as a collection of partly older packages was in the second half of 2016.
All its packages "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."^[citation from [tidyverse homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/)]
It is for sure difficult to tell, if "learning the `tidyverse`" is a hard task, since the result of this assessment might differ from person to person.
We do believe though, that there are concepts in its approach, which -- when grasped -- have the potential to increase one's productivity, since code creation will seem more natural.
While this might be true for all languages (once you speak it well enough, things go smoothly), in our opinion the `tidyverse` worth exploring in depth, since it is 
    1. an especially thought through framework that aims at making programming intuitive
    2. evolving: challenges in the quickly changing world of hardware and software technology are addressed by `tidyverse` developers on comparably short notice
    3. ...
