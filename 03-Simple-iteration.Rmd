# Simple iteration

> Processing multiple files that contain different parts of the same dataset

This chapter introduces iteration as a concept to repeat the same operation over a sequence of inputs.
It is largely independent of the previous chapter.

```{r 03-setup, include = FALSE}
library(here)
```


```{r child = here("script", "3.Rmd")}
```
