# Pairwise iteration and nesting

This chapter explores iterating over pairs (or generally lists) of vectors of the same length.
The relationship between vectors and data frame columns is especially helpful here, because values in one row of a tibble naturally correspond to accessing the same index in multiple vectors.

```{r 04-setup, include = FALSE}
library(here)
```


```{r child = here("script", "4.Rmd")}
```
